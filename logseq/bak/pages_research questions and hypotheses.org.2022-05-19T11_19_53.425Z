* What is a good topic?
** is not too general but also not too specific
** should have further relevance for linguistics
** includes new aspects based on state of the art in the relevant theories
** interesting and doable
** is based on previous knowledge and/or observations
** allows for a number of research questions
* Topic
** a more general account of what your are interested in
** a vague formulation of your project
** the area and discipline you are working in
** *example*: The language of teenagers
* Title
** is the business card of your paper/thesis
** must be informative and explicit
** must have a reasonable link to the content
** must not raise expectations that are not met in the paper
** *example*: /Teenage talk - a sociolinguistic study of the forms and functions of youth language/
* Determining the aim(s)

Your topic and a preliminary title in mind you work out a set of research questions and/or hypotheses suitable to be applied to empirical data (operationalisation) or to challenge theoretical positions.
** Research questions

RQ is important for choosing & evaluating empirical data and theoretical concepts & literatureâ€¨

"This is because a piece of empirical research is normally designed to address one or more research questions - the answers to which should constitute a 'contribution to knowledge'." ([[Sunderland2010ResearchQuestions]]:10)

start out with RQ as a guideline for your project: it can be a rather broadly formulated RQ, but also a number of relatively small and precise RQs
while progressing, refine your RQs, make them more precise or more general or add new ones
don't miss the point where your RQs have to be fixed
