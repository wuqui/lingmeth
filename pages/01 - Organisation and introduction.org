This course will guide you through the entire process of designing a research project in linguistics, from identifying a topic to presenting a research project proposal in written form (e.g. for a term paper, your BA thesis or Zulassungsarbeit).

You will be offered practical advice on:

- planning and organising your work
- identifying and narrowing a topic
- developing and refining research questions
- finding and managing background information and literature
- effective and sustainable note-taking
- referencing literature and avoiding plagiarism
- collecting and analysing data using various methods (e.g. corpora, surveys)
- reporting results and academic writing

For every topic, I will provide basic material and questions for discussion. We will work on and discuss your project ideas, and you will have the chance to present your projects to get constructive feedback.

We will have weekly sessions in person during regular course time.
