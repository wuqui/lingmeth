** Specifics
*** First idea on neologisms: two neologisms from technology, one from CoviD, two from a social environment
*** Second idea on neologisms: three neologisms that arose from a development generally seen as positive in society/politics/or dominant poltical party (technical innovation, medicine etc.), three that arose from a development seen as negative (war, disease, disaster)
