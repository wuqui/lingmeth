** Topic: Tone and emotion when using neologism over time
** Hypothesis: Frequency of positive and negative tone and emotion in neologism use change over time
** Research Question: What differences in positive and negative emotion as well as tone can found in a 5 word context around neologisms during diffusion?
** Idea
*** First idea on neologisms: two neologisms from technology, one from CoviD, two from a social environment
*** Second idea on neologisms: three neologisms that arose from a development generally seen as positive in society/politics/or dominant political party (technical innovation, medicine etc.), three that arose from a development seen as negative (war, disease, disaster)
** Data
** Tools/Methods
*** LIWC
*** OED
*** english-corpora.org
** References
** Plan
*** Things to do + details
**** Prototype
***** choose a neologism: "smartphone"
***** research the S-curve in corpora: WHICH ONE
****** N.O.W. corpus: signals societal interest OR what will BECOME of societal interest (lenkende funktion); sehr groÃŸ; sehr aktuell (wird immernoch aktualisiert); aber erst seit 2010

:END:
****** COCA corpus: 1990-2019 is a good time-span
***** find entries on OED for two specific points in time and a 5 word context around the hit & download: web crawler? ("dataminer"?)
***** enter into LWIC & determine dominant tone & degree of emotion in context
***** Reflection: is there any difference? is there historical development that supports this?
**** Literature
***** Go on google scholar and look for:
****** attitudes to change & innovation
****** attitudes to neologisms
****** tone in neologism use
****** tone when talking about technological innovation
***** make a list & short notes
**** Write Intro
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** choose most interesting point
***** expected outcome
***** research question & hypothesis
***** shorten!
**** Write Theory Part
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** look at previous notes
***** create visual representation
***** first draft
***** 2 day break no matter what
***** second draft
**** Do Research & write protocoll
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** choose final list (max. 4) of neologisms in OED
***** try to find web crawler
***** find S-curve for each neologism in corpora
***** try to find which points in time are best for each neologism (preferably on same points of the S-curve though) -> put into excel
***** get corpora results for 2 points in time each
***** put into LIWC
***** create Excel spreadsheets of LIWC results
***** Protocol: just keep track in word, divide into different phases (data extraction, historical research, technical research, LIWC)
**** Write methods/research part
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** use protocoll
***** revise categories/steps in methodology
***** link references as to why methodology makes sense (S-curve, LIWC)
***** explain limitations
**** Do results (diagramms etc.)
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** use excel spreadsheets to create relevant diagrams
***** Compare:
****** Tone within one neologism
****** Tone within multiple neologism but same point on S-curve
****** Difference in tone between 2 points in time within multiple neologisms
**** Write results
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** Create a logical sequence of results
***** Write & add in diagrams, queries etc.
***** 2 days break
***** take notes on possible conclusioon
***** revise
**** Revise Theory & Intro
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** See if theory part still makes sense considering the results
***** see if intro still makes sense with probable conclusion/discussion
**** Write discussion/conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** actually write the conclusion using notes, results, and revised introduction
***** take a break
***** revise
**** Submission for methods: in August (26.)
*** Schedules (deadlines)
**** 16.06.22: Prototype
**** 23.06.22: Literature + Intro
**** 30.06.22: Notes on Theory part &  start research
**** 07.07.22: Research phase
**** 14.07.22: Break: Write Theory part
**** 21.07.22: Research phase
**** 28.07.22: Write methods/research part
**** 04.08.22: Do results & write
**** 11.08.22: revise theory & intro + write conclusion
**** 18.08.22: proof-read
**** 26.08.22: Submission!
